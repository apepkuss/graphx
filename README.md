## GraphX

### Short Introduction

GraphX is a library of graph algorithms, and it is in rust. The motivations of this project are

* Learning-by-doing: sharpen rust skills;
* Problem solver: implement common graph algorithms which are widely used in daily coding tasks.


### Change Log

* 0.1.0
    * Graph trait.
    * DiGraph struct for directed graph and Node struct.
    * Graph-subgraph isomorphism.
