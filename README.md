## GraphX

### Short Introduction

GraphX is a library of graph algorithms, and it is in rust. The motivations of this project are

* Learning-by-doing: sharpen rust skills;
* Problem solver: implement common graph algorithms which are widely used in daily coding tasks.


### Change Log

    * Graph trait
    * Node trait
    * DiGraph struct and DiNode struct
    * algorithm mod
        * Graph-subgraph isomorphism
        * Topsort
